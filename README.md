# CNYT-CLASSICAL-TO-QUANTUM-LIBRARY

Classical to Quantum Library . CNYT. Some operations with 

In this library we perform experiments of quantum systems,like:

  - The marble experiments with Boolean coefficients.
  - Probabilistic classic multiple slit experiments, with more than two slits.
  - Quantum multiple slits experiment.
  - Graph with a bar chart showing the probabilities of a vector of state. 

## Getting Started

In order to use the following functions you´ll need to use tuples instead of the normal structure of the complex numbers the following example will guide you on how to convert normal expression into tuples.


### Prerequisites

  - Python version 3.7 or higher
